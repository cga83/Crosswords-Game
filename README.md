# Crosswords-Game
## Introduction
### What is this game ?
It is a game I developed for a school project. There is a grid of hidden words and the purpose of the game is to find the different hidden words. There are two modes: one where the computer can play and another one where you can play. There is a file containing all the hidden words of the grid. The game is over when you have find all the words in this file.

At the beginning of the game, you have to write "1", "2", or "3" to make the computer play, to play yourselves or to quit.

For instance, if you choose to make the computer play, you will get:

### Code
This code was written in C. There are four different files:
1. Prog.c : where all the functions are written
2. Prog.h : where all the prototypes are written
3. main.c : where the main program is written
4. makefile : a makefile to compile the program

There are also four grids for you to play.

### How to execute the game
To execute my game, you can write "make" in your console to compile it and then you can write "./Jeu Grille1.txt Liste1.txt" in your console in order to play with the first grid. If you want to play with the 2nd or 3rd grid you just have to change the number of the grid.

### To-do list
- Graphic interface.
