# Crosswords-Game
It's a game I designed for a school project

This is my crosswords game !

To execute my game, you can write "make" in your console to compile it and then you can write "./Jeu Grille1.txt Liste1.txt" in your console in order to play with the first grid. If you want to play with the 2nd or 3rd grid you just have to change the number.
